# Yul Examples

This project includes examples of working with Inline Assembly in Solidity Contracts to understand the basic principles of working with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Solidity, and Yul. These examples cover concepts such as interaction with different types of data, recording data in Storage and Memory, Pure ABI Encoding, and more.

While many of the algorithms in this project can be significantly improved, the focus was on understanding the underlying principles of working with Solidity.

The project is inspired by JEFFREY SCHOLZ's course https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sOLIDITY-YUL-AL-SSEMBLY/ and its repository https://github.com/rareeskills/udemy-yul-code
